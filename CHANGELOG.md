### next version
* Improved src checking to allow `<img/>` tags (not `<Image/>` components) to
  use external paths. They will not be processed (as usual), but they also will
  not crash the server.
* Added Feature: preserve nested folder structure when generating images

### 0.0.9
* Fixed Safari display bug
